# GuessTheNumberGame

A simple game in which the phone tries to guess the selected number.

## Lessons Learned

This is my second application written in React Native. I learned how to install the SDK and use it. The SDKs I used are LinearGradient and AppLoading. In addition, I learned how to run complex projects with more components.
My first application created with React Native during the course.
I still need to fix a few things.
